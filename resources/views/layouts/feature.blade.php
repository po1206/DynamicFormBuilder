          <h3>How does GoDaddy help small business owners succeed?</h3>
          <p>GoDaddy offers more than just a platform to build your website, we offer everything you need
            to create an effective, memorable online presence. Already have a site? We offer hosting
            plans that will keep it fast, secure and online. Our professional email helps you build a

            online, backed with expert, personalized support from GoDaddy Guides.</p>

          <h3>Why do I need a website for my business?</h3>
          <p>Even small local businesses that only serve their hometown need a site. That's because the
            web is the first place people go when looking for a product or service. A website helps
            every business: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Promote and sell their products and services</li>
            <li>Connect with new customers (and keep existing customers)/li>
            <li>Build credibility</li>
            <li>Compete with bigger businesses</li>
            <li>Control their brand and keep their marketing fresh and current</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Best of all, a website is much easier and more affordable than you might think. GoDaddy

            and marketing options to grow their business on the web.</p>

          <h3>Why do I need a professional email?</h3>
          <p>There are a lot of reasons to switch from your free email to a domain-based email, but here
            are the top 3: </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Customers are much more likely to trust a professional address like lily@lilysbikes.com
              than lilysbikestexas84@notmail.com.</li>
            <li>Professional Email provides world-class security with industry-leading spam and
              virus filters.</li>
            <li>Personalized email addresses promote your business more effectively. Every time you send
              an email, you are giving your web address to customers and prospects, encouraging them
              to visit your website.</li>
          </ol>

        <div class="que__ans">

          <h3>Why should I transfer my domain, website or web hosting to GoDaddy?</h3>
          <p>
            There are a few different reasons. Our award-winning support is always high on the list of
            why people move their presence to GoDaddy. Of course, our prices — including a free 1-year
